### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working to optimize projects I've built before, while continuing to expand upon my understanding of technologies I'm already familiar with: HTML5, CSS3, PYTHON, VANILLA-JS, NODE.JS, EXPRESS, REACT, REDUX, PYTHON, FLASK, SQL-ALCHEMY, ALEMBIC, PSQL.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on the development of full stack web applications and games... even better, both at the same time.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deepening my understanding of machine learning, and how neural-networks differ from hard coding a program.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: nathanield.cooke@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Huge Nikola Tesla fan, life long engineer, born and raised in Las Vegas, NV.
